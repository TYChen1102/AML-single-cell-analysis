# AML-single-cell-analysis
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer with excess immature blood cells in the bone marrow. One of the characteristics of AML is heterogeneity which refers to the existence of diverse cell types within a single AML sample and contributes to treatment resistance. Finding out how cell types and gene expression change with drug treatment is important for developing more effective cancer therapies.

In this research, we applied a deep recurrent network architecture and autoencoder based model with modified clustering training processes for sensitive cell-type composition identification. We analyzed single-cell transcriptomics data between healthy people and AML patients before and after undergoing chemotherapy.

The notebook 'RNN_clustering_final.ipynb' contains an example of data normalization, dimensionality reduction and visualization.
